Type less and save your fingers, install `N` and all you need is:
`Program.cs`
```csharp
N();
```
Want to be asynchronous?
```csharp
await T;
```
Want to return?
```csharp
return I;
```
Want to increment?
```csharp
++I;
```
or
```csharp
I++;
```
Decrement?
```csharp
--I;
```
or
```csharp
I--;
```
Absolutely need to assign something?
```csharp
I=I;
```
What about `args`? `N`s got you covered.
```csharp
N(args);
```
