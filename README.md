Tired of boilerplate? Then N is for you!

## Less
Type less and save your fingers, install `N` and all you need is:
`Program.cs`
```csharp
N();
```
Want to be asynchronous? (World's Smallest C# async/await Program)
```csharp
await T;
```
Want to return a code?
```csharp
return I;
```
Want to increment?
```csharp
++I;
```
or
```csharp
I++;
```
Decrement?
```csharp
--I;
```
or
```csharp
I--;
```
Absolutely need to assign something?
```csharp
I=0;
```
or
```csharp
I=I;
```
Need to new something up:
```csharp
new O();
```
What about `args`? `N`s got you covered.
```csharp
N(args);
```
Want to just return? You don't need `N` ;)
```csharp
return;
```
This should be the world's smallest C# program out-of-the-box in .NET 6 and C# 10.
